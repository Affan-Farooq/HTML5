# HTML Basics

Welcome to the **HTML Basics** directory! This directory is designed as an introductory guide to essential HTML concepts, covering core tags and structures used to build simple, well-structured web pages. Each file here demonstrates specific HTML elements and practices that are foundational for creating web content.

## Learning Goals

By exploring this directory, you’ll learn how to:
- Structure a basic HTML document.
- Use various text formatting tags.
- Add hyperlinks and images to a webpage.
- Organize content with ordered, unordered, and description lists.

## Directory Contents

Each file in this directory focuses on a particular HTML concept and includes explanations and examples of how to use each tag effectively.

### Files Overview

1. **`index.html`**  
   This file introduces the basic structure of an HTML document, including essential components like the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Key elements in the `<head>` section, such as metadata and the document `<title>`, are also covered.  
   
   **Learning Points:**
   - Understanding HTML document structure.
   - Adding metadata (e.g., `charset`, `viewport`) for better performance and accessibility.
   - Proper usage of the `<title>` tag for setting page titles.

2. **`text_elements.html`**  
   This file provides examples of text formatting and layout tags, such as headings, paragraphs, and various inline text styles. You’ll find explanations on how to create different levels of headings, as well as how to emphasize or style text for readability.

   **Learning Points:**
   - Using heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) for creating content hierarchy.
   - Structuring content with paragraphs (`<p>`).
   - Adding emphasis with tags like `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<u>`.

3. **`links_images.html`**  
   This file demonstrates how to add hyperlinks and images, two of the most common and useful features in HTML. You’ll learn to link to internal and external pages, as well as embed images with descriptive `alt` text for accessibility.

   **Learning Points:**
   - Creating hyperlinks with the `<a>` tag, including `href` and `target` attributes.
   - Embedding images with the `<img>` tag, using `src` and `alt` attributes.
   - Setting images to open links in new tabs with `target="_blank"`.

4. **`lists.html`**  
   This file explores the three primary types of lists in HTML: ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists. It includes examples of nested lists, which are useful for creating multi-level content such as outlines or feature lists.

   **Learning Points:**
   - Organizing items with ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`).
   - Defining term-description pairs with description lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`).
   - Structuring nested lists to create complex outlines or hierarchies.

## Getting Started

Each HTML file is self-contained and can be viewed in any modern web browser. Simply open each file in a browser to see the output and follow along with the examples provided in the HTML source.

If you’re interested in experimenting:
1. **Clone the Repository** or download the files to your local machine.
2. Open each file in a text editor to view the code.
3. Modify and save the files as you learn, then refresh the browser to see changes in real time.

## Suggested Learning Path

To make the most of this basics directory, follow this recommended order:
1. **Start with `index.html`** to understand the structure of an HTML document.
2. **Move on to `text_elements.html`** to learn text formatting and content organization.
3. **Explore `links_images.html`** to learn how to add links and images to make web pages interactive.
4. **Finish with `lists.html`** to understand list structures, which are essential for organizing content effectively.
