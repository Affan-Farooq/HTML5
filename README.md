# HTML5 Repository

Welcome to my **HTML5** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work in HTML5, covering everything from fundamental concepts to advanced topics. Each section showcases my exploration and practice with HTML5 features, organized into structured sections for my own development and reference. Feel free to explore and see how I’ve applied these HTML concepts in a practical context.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main directories:

1. **`basics/`** - Foundational HTML concepts and elements.
2. **`intermediate/`** - More complex structures and interactive HTML elements.
3. **`advanced/`** - Advanced HTML5 techniques and APIs for dynamic content.

Each directory contains HTML files focused on specific topics, with detailed examples demonstrating my work with each concept.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning resource for me to document my progress and understanding of HTML5. Through these files, I have applied essential, intermediate, and advanced HTML elements to build a comprehensive foundation in HTML5. It reflects both my learning path and a personal reference to revisit concepts as needed.

## Directory Overview

### `basics/`
The `basics/` directory includes fundamental HTML elements, providing a solid starting point for building well-structured web pages.

- **Topics Covered:**
    - Basic HTML structure (`index.html`)
    - Text formatting and headings (`text_elements.html`)
    - Links and images (`links_images.html`)
    - Lists (`lists.html`)

### `intermediate/`
The `intermediate/` directory builds upon foundational skills with more advanced HTML elements for creating interactive and organized web content.

- **Topics Covered:**
    - Tables for structured data (`tables.html`)
    - Forms with various input types (`forms_inputs.html`)
    - Multimedia elements (`media.html`)
    - Semantic HTML elements (`semantic_elements.html`)

### `advanced/`
The `advanced/` directory covers some of HTML5’s more powerful and intricate features, allowing for enhanced functionality and interaction.

- **Topics Covered:**
    - HTML5 form validation techniques (`form_validation.html`)
    - Metadata for SEO and social media optimization (`metadata_seo.html`)
    - HTML5 APIs, like Geolocation, Web Storage, and Canvas (`html5_apis.html`)
    - Special characters and entities (`special_characters.html`)

## Suggested Path

Although this is structured as my personal learning path, if you’re exploring HTML5 in a similar way, here’s a suggested progression:
1. **Start with `basics/`** to get comfortable with essential HTML elements.
2. **Move to `intermediate/`** to explore tables, forms, multimedia, and semantics.
3. **Progress to `advanced/`** for more dynamic features, form validation, and HTML5 APIs.

## Getting Started

To view my work:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Affan-Farooq/HTML5.git
   ```
2. **Browse by Directory**: Start with the `basics/` directory and move through the sections at your own pace.
3. **Experiment with Code**: Each file is self-contained and can be modified in any text editor. Try out my examples and add your own variations to see HTML5 in action.
